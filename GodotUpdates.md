# Godot2DPlatformer
An old project of mine was corrupted and as such I lost 80% of it, so instead of trying to piece it back together
I have decided to relearn Godot and develop a basic platformer which I plan to scale as time goes on.

I will be noting any updates as this project goes onand any road blocks I encounter along the way, along with how I pass them.

I spent some time figuring out how the tilemap worked and drew out a very basic 
platform with two pillars which stuck out so I had a reference to tweak jumping once I scripted it into my sprite. 
After doing a quick overview on the syntax of the Godot scripting language, I wrote some basic code to be able to move my sprite. My first roadblock came
when animating my sprite, the idle animation works perfectly, 
as does the jumping animation (although I need to figure out how to get it to only run once rather than constantly repeating while the button is pressed)
however, the walk animation doesn't seem to trigger when the player is moving, 
I've watched multiple tutorials and the code is very similar. I may try to rewrite the Sprite script 
but for now I'm going to focus on creating a map to then be able to add a few enemies.
